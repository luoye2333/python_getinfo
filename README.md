# python_getinfo
get steam info(recommendations&amp;friends)
get recommendations:
gets info every 10 seconds
cause you cannot achieve all recommendations in one time
they are hided within the slide bar&cannot be achieved

get friends info:
level high to level low(depth first searching)
ending up in circular
because high level(lv=500+) players have similar friends

it is used to verify the theory that:
all people can be connected within 6 friends
i think it impossible though
because it needs a huge network to show relationships


to be improved
